# K-means-Clustering

This project aim to show how to use K-means clustering in unsupervised machine learning.

One thing worth mention is that you can actually use K-means clustering in all supervised machine case, the only thing you need to do is to exclude the label in training and reserve them to compare with your predictions.

I will show a simple example here. 

Again, I will use the titanic survival model as an example.
