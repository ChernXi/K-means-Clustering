# K-means-Clustering

This project aims to show how to use K-means clustering in unsupervised machine learning.

## When to use it
K means clustering is best to use when all features are almost equally correlated to grouping.

## Example
Classify students into two groups, science stream and art stream, according to their results.<br>
The dataset I used is not an authentic one, rather, it was generated by using the "randbetween" function of microsoft excel. <br>
The first 25 students' score were generated by using the same formula, with the aim to show some typical results of the science stream students. <br>
The last 25 students' score were generated by using another formula, with the aim to show some typical results of the art stream students. <br>
